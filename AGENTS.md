- Use Lovable Cloud authentication and private per-user profiles for persistent accounts; the user explicitly requested real database-backed accounts.
- Store bookmarks and post reports as private per-user records protected by database access rules, so saved content and reports cannot leak between accounts.
- Verification badges come from verified_badges (server writes only, after on-chain ERC20 payment checks); ybs, thorvox, mindcaster stay curated in presentation code.
- Store user language and appearance preferences locally so display choices apply immediately without profile writes.
- Keep follow relationships in the user_follows table with authenticated row-level access; follows must persist across sessions.
- Media uploads go browser→R2 via short-lived signed URLs from a server function; R2 keys never reach the browser.
- FOMO API calls run server-side through one key pool that rotates keys and pauses ones that hit limits, with short in-memory caching.
